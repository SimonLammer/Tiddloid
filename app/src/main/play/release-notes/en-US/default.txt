Update details:

  - If any wiki opened:
    - Any selected text sent here will be append to opened wiki as a draft tiddler
    - Any other file sent here will get prepared for import and stacked in $:/Import
  - If no wiki opened:
    - Any selected text will be parsed, and open the link inside if possible; otherwise the default wiki will be opened and the text will be append there as a draft tiddler
    - Any HTML file sent here will be opened as a template
    - Any files will let the default wiki be opened and imported here
